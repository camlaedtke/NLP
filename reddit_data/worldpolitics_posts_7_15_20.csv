An explanation of what had happened,Kirito2750,1588975164.0,4288,self.worldpolitics,"'Why is there porn and memes and all sorts of of potpourri on this once mediocre subreddit you ask? I shall explain. \n\nThere were a great number of posts of the following format:\n‚ÄúUpvote this picture so it is the first thing seen when googling ________‚Äù with generally amazing unfortunate angle of an American republican politician. \n\nA great many people complained to the moderators, saying that this is obvious karma farming, and that is against the rules of the sub, however there was no action taken, most likely because ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù. Eventually the user u/TheLoiiLicker69 posted in rebellion a drawn image of anime breasts, with a title saying ‚Äúyour move moderators‚Äù or some such thing. It was decided by the moderators that no action against this post would be taken, and so many others followed the trend of hentai. \n\nAfter a few hours, however, a few users began to post meta memes about what has happened to the sub, which was followed shortly by more general memes, and a few hours later, the first users began posting their own nude photos, generally in the beginning of their breasts, as the first NSFW post was of animated breasts. \n\nA subreddit was created during the period of only hentai, called r/anime_titties which is a world news subreddit that disallows all US coverage. \n\nLater, moderators gave tacet approval to the chaos by posting that we must keep things within the law, and all photos must be posted with consent of those within. \n\nThis is where we stand today. Please send this to moderators so it can be pinned or something, because I am REALLY sick of explaining this to everyone in individual comment threads\n\nUpdate: on the 15th of May, the war hammer subreddit invaded, posting photos and art from warhammer 40k, which was met by a resistance of photos of plants attempting to stem the tide. It was suggested that this subreddit becomes the holy land, constantly being invaded by others.\n\nUpdate: there has since been a massive war between a number of different subs invading the holy land of r/worldpolitics for a few days, before peace was made'",gg2nv0,1.0
